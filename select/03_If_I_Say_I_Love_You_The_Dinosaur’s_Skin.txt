If I say I love you
Will you go catch the stars for me
If I become the night sky
Can you kiss me and let in all the sunlight
When I say I want you
May every inch of you be mine
If there are tears in the sky
It's me staring too long into your eyes
Oh I miss you tonight
If that's what love do to your eyes then I would be blind
You're like the morning sun and oh it hurts so bad
To watch you rise and go to a place far far away
If the world stops spinning
You're my reason to carry on
If we are oceans apart
Let me be your eyes and show you the stars
Oh I miss you tonight
If that's what love do to your eyes then I would be blind
You're like the morning sun and oh it hurts so bad
To watch you rise and go to a place far far away
Oh I will be fine
You keep me warm even though I might be dead inside
I can't get any closer oh how hard I tried
Please don't leave me here we are so far far apart
If I say I love you
Will you open your eyes for me
If you're a ghost in a shell
Let me hold you and break free from this spell"
